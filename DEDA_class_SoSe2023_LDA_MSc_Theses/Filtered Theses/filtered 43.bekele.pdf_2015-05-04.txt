greatly large commonly use significance level therefore test indicates two covariate model assumption proportional hazard hold nevertheless model two covariates proportionality assumption violate necessary modify cox model accordingly therefore order incorporate non proportional hazard rate model stratify cox model scm need apply stratify cox model important notice scm accommodate categorical variable whereas cphm allows indicator variable also derive categorical variable metric variable indeed possible even scm include metric covariates group data appropriately therefore hazard function stratify context look follow ex defines stratum thus hazard rate differ stratum hold also true baseline hazard function hf must estimate simultaneously group necessary specific likelihood partial

covariates use large model fulfill proportionality assumption would need include scm stratas therefore two covariates ddivorce fatheducuni would directly include model effect stratify covariates dependent variable measure anymore method apply thus kind model would defeat purpose analysis consequently carry mention possibility handle non proportional hazard hosmer lemeshow ff conclusion
