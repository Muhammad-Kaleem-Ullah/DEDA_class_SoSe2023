paper clearly present business issue objective introduces need theoretical background related predictive model evaluation order complete successfully properly give goal introduce data present detail approach finally result first regard time dimension concern spatial aspect context objective recommender engine recommender system define algorithm attribute every entity rating towards product provide mapping customer preference thus algorithm able fulfil goal recommend right product entity engine common lot marketplace typical example line retailer visitor see product also see list related product base people bought product also bought goal clearly make customer buy however case line marketplace somehow simpler line retailer indeed line retailer disposal lot data customer exactly know product customer bought saw website line retailer data collection straightforward even possible reproduce whole onealternative collect data institute loyalty card precisely recommender engine work intend holder loyalty card retailer concretely customer possibility go specific terminal shop go shopping scan loyalty card get coupon contain discount specific product available supermarket bet customer buy product get use afterwards product remain cart every time come retailer recommender engine see investment make customer buy product first purchase represent cost discount product becomes beneficial customer keep buying recommender engine also way make customer loyal dissuade go competitor offering discount soon come introduction recommender engine chain supermarket explain start point study recommender engine holder loyalty supermarket card recommender engine calibrate several experi ments take place begin year month experiment consist give discount coupon holder specific product discount percentage randomly attribute also product call campaign randomly attribute observe whether customer us coupon call observe redemption recommender engine first introduce different shop surround area total experiment lead observation observation corresponds one price specific product coupon finally data experiment store database basket customer report together coupon whether use lastly holder characteristic purpose database obviously learn supermarket chain want remain anonymous behaviour customer order improve recommender engine calibration discount coupon recommender engine set attribute right product right customer challenge attribute right discount make customer use opposite constraint interact customer least sufficient incentive use coupon word price high enough customer willing buy product coupon otherwise coupon simply use customer chance buy machine appear useless discount high indeed coupon use represent cost retailer product sell normal price low price often loss retailer give many high discount coupon otherwise simply loose much money contradiction retailer face recommender engine investment make customer loyal make buy retailer need predict redemption coupon calibrate model respect budgetary constraint prediction key problem accurate enough underperform sense discount would low encourage people use coupon recommender engine would use full possibility customer would incite use continue go retailer initial goal would achieve opposite underestimate redemption consequently attribute high discount finally budgetary constraint may respect challenge therefore make prediction accurate possible avoid two risk formally probability use coupon model logistic regres sion accord price consumer property note variable interest dummy variable redemption whether thecouponwasused model follow price discrimination obtain maximise budget constraint objective objective study improve model predict redemption order optimize recommender engine satisfy budgetary constraint order improve prediction model several option try model compare accuracy prediction take account parameter may influence redemption work focus second option specifically attempt introduce two new dimension model far time dimension spatial geographical dimension time dimension first time matter consumer choice make sense think accord periodoftheyear chocolatesbefore easter christmas barbecue meat summer pen paper september case specific example people would likely use coupon recommender engine attribute thus time within year matter day week also parameter interest indeed people buy different thing accord whether go shopping monday friday plausible end week instance beer alcoholic beverage snack susceptible bought since people usually go mostly week end finally moment day also parameter interest think sat urdays instance product first necessity may bought morning whereas asimilar statement may apply day week since day kind customer go shopping evening right office hour three time dimension may allow estimate precisely probability customer use discount coupon unfortunately experiment get data last long time month thus even consider first mention dimension moment year since data couple month regard dimension example dataset argues sense time matter analyse customer behaviour graph show proportion customer ever bought woman product among customer come supermarket scan loyalty card clearly see graph morning type customer represent whereas evening always represent geographical dimension geographical dimension also matter analyse customer behaviour proportion woman product customer among loyalty card holder su permarkets first accord surroundings neighbourhood population come etc purchase customer preference specific store may different another one neighbourhood mostly young people live consumption interest coca cola product must high residential area proportion retire likely highly competitive area meaning area lot supermarket hypermarket incentive need strong others consider store preserve competitor near surroundings finally characteristic shop consider may influence cu tomers preference indeed available section service may influence reason customer come specific store preference purpose thesis see previously mention parameter influence probability redemption loyalty card holder theoretical background incorporate work within framework business logic statis tical tool method may useful put practice introduce logistic model described previously business problem predict customer behaviour summarize binary variable whether customer use coupon binary outcome first model come mind obviously logistic regression actually model use recommender engine recall logistic function define follow logistic regression equation thus nxn parameter estimate usually maximize likelihood main asset logistic regression justify model cho sen scalability model rather easy compute need lot resource even big number observation spread output model quite easy interpret aboutthislastpoint regression directly interpretable comparison linear regression instance indeed sign allows say whether positive negative influence dependent variable odd ratio pretty useful get quantitative interpretation coefficient odds relative probability reflect likelihood event happen case binary variable divide probability success probability failure odd ratio simply ratio two odds compare odds event two distinct environment odd ratio define follow odds odds take see effect increase independent variable one unit likelihood dependent variable odds odds replace get result easily generalise logistic regression independent variable thus interpretation actually useful understand influence customer however model term predictive accuracy evaluation model predictive power itisnecessary precise ass predictive power logistic regression test prediction first assessment get idea performance model need test observation already know output word need run estimate model order get prediction data point compare real observation way go usually split whole sample two subset one estimate model one test use data training model test would rigorous actually disposal quite big sample allows large training test set regard split model share observation put aside test ing strict rule however well keep observation model estimation training usually observation dedicate model estimation whereas remain integrate test set depends number observation many observation may oblige user reduce share training data avoid high computational cost contrary observation may force increase get consistent estimation another approach test model would go fold cross classification principle split database sub sample train model subset evaluate remain one finally repeat process change validation set method actually quite costly term resource allows robust estimation accuracy paradox two set estimate model training data estimate prediction test data measure efficiency model usually three different type metric distinguish term predictive model evaluation threshold metric ass predictive power model also threshold ass close predict class actual class accurate predict class give specific threshold rank metric ass predictive power model take ac countanythreshold moreprecisely see coherence real class test observation compare output probability actual class test observation basic intuitive approach measure efficiency predictive model would consider accuracy model specifically call percentage correctly classify pcc define number accurate prediction total number prediction threshold metric since take predict class predict probability already assume certain threshold acc pcc yi actual observation predict class

probability need define decision threshold also call cutoff consider case unbalanced class mean huge share observation training sample belongs one class consider class negative one probability success pretty low round probability probably lead get negative prediction show confusion matrix round actually mean take decision threshold actual class negative positive predict negative class positive confusion matrix accuracy paradox accuracy prediction equal seem promising consid ering another decision threshold prediction low previous one obtain follow confusion matrix accuracy second threshold low first one however first threshold would completely useless predicts negative case point use actually accuracy paradox globally accuracy good reliable measure prediction especially underlie variable unbalanced indeed variable class unbalanced actual class negative positive predict negative class positive confusion matrix accuracy paradox risk prediction take value largely represent class accuracy super high indicator evaluate predictive power thus need introduce concept since predictive power model summarize accuracy indicator two widely use specificity sensitivity indicator also base confusion matrix specificity also call true negative rate tnr tn tnr tn fp sensitivity also call true positive rate tpr tp tpr tp fn good predictive model obviously get high specificity well high sensitivity first confusion matrix example specificity would sen sitivity would therefore see accuracy reflect complete predictive power model consider example clinical test positive would mean patient disease main goal clearly minimize number false negative therefore decision threshold would one maximize sensitivity however project precise goal goal somehow maximize indicator since misclassification high cost similarly specificity sensitivity define false positive rate fpr false negative rate fnr false negative rate fn fnr sensitivity fn tp false positive rate fp fpr specificity fp tn rate obviously minimize low well model specificity sensitivity precise target regard model carrier certain disease however redemption prediction want minimize without specific distinction roc curve different indicator introduce receiver operating characteristic roc curve mention curve actually representation predictive performance model take account infinity classifier meaning change decision threshold separate positive prediction negative one curve illustrates relationship sensitivity specificity indeed roc curve axis represent fpr specificity axis tpr sensitivity point represent different classifier model obtain change decision threshold prediction distribution graph represent decision threshold equal prediction negative represent decision threshold equal prediction positive ideal point positive prediction true positive none wrongly positive thus go negative one diagonal represent random guess randomly distribute prediction case rate true positive equal rate false

understandable big area predictive power model indeed closer curve point big area two model one roc curve lie automatically auc also high auc always since curve locate within unit square auc equal several meaning predictive model attribute prediction every test observation positive negative would mean roc diagonal unit square predictive model attribute prediction two different class distribution result roc close diagonal predictive model give half two class half therefore auc necessarily mean random prediction high say model well random guess closer well finally auc measure

topic first time dimension exploratory analysis require order point main parameter influence redemption rate somehow guide introduction time dimension model exploratory analysis first clearly see redemption rate varies accord day week tuesday redemption much rarer end week saturday redemption rate day week might simply end week customer less hurry spend time shop also likely pay real attention coupon go section discount product consider buying another explanation could week people simply go supermarket buy thing miss home opposite end week go order literally fill stock buy large range product therefore likely buy discount product redemption rate also change accord moment day graph redemption rate broken opening hour day see redemption rate go long day go could explain similar
